# Infinite-World
## Description
I developped this project for my grade 12 programming course (ICS4U). I created the project with the aim of developping a procedurally generated 2D game. The result is this infinite map that you can scroll around forever. The game implements Perlin noise to create an infinite 2 dimensional landscape.
